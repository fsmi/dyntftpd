- create a debian package
- more complex fs overlays: allow more than one tree to be mounted into the
  provided tftp tree. (Use case: provide a test/ directory with kernel images
  from a testing branch.)
- use private modules to private namespace
- support invocation via inetd
- modules loaded from profile configuration files should not remain in memory
  or should somehow be forced to reload the next time the profile configuration
  is loaded.
